# When you start to work on this you will need to use renv which takes care of the libraries and their versions. A bit more setup, a much #ess drama.

- in console run: 

// if you're just joining the project, you might need

```
install.packages('renv')
```

## this will restore libraries. you might wanna do this after pulling. Choose "1: Activate the project and use the project library", you might have to do it twice 

```
renv::restore()
```

## (if you added new libraries) this will create a new record which can be restored. Choose 2: Install the packages, then snapshot.

```
renv::snapshot()
```

## of if drama:

```
renv::rebuild()
```

# only first time (try first without this). then pick 'reactivate (2)'

```
renv::init() 
```

- then in R studio use the button Render.
